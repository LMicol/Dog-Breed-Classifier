# Dog-Breed-Classifier

This is the capstone project from udacity Machine Learning nano degree. The objective of this project was to develop a program capable of detecting if an image contains a dog and providing its breed, or detect if the image contains a human and estimate the dog breed that is most resembling.

This project aims to mix different machine learning techniques in a single model, the real challenge was to learn these techniques and combine them to reach the final goal. 

Some techniques that were used in this project: 
* OpenCV's;
* Recurrent neural network; 
* Transfered Learning (Resnet101, VGG-16)

You can check the project on the "dog_app.ipynb" or "dog_app.html" files. The major libraries used were:
* Numpy
* Pytorch
* Matplotlib
* Cv2                


The images used for traning and testing were provided by the udacity, you can download on the following link:
